Let me extract and manually convert each program from the document into Python code. This might take some time as I carefully process and format all programs. I'll provide them sequentially.

### Problem 1: Commands and Network Protocol Analysis

This involves using tools like `tcpdump`, `netstat`, `ifconfig`, etc. These are system commands and cannot be directly translated into Python, but we can use Python's `subprocess` module to execute them.

```python
import subprocess

def run_command(command):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, text=True, capture_output=True)
        print(f"Output of '{command}':\n{result.stdout}")
        if result.stderr:
            print(f"Error:\n{result.stderr}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing '{command}': {e}")

# Example usage
commands = ["ifconfig", "netstat -tuln", "traceroute www.google.com"]
for cmd in commands:
    run_command(cmd)
```

### Problem 2: Study Networking Devices

This problem is theoretical and doesn't require a program. For learning purposes, you can create a dictionary to summarize networking devices.

```python
network_devices = {
    "Repeater": "An electronic device that receives and retransmits a signal at a higher level.",
    "Hub": "Connects multiple devices in a network, working at the physical layer.",
    "Switch": "Connects devices and routes data at the data link layer.",
    "Bridge": "Connects multiple network segments at the data link layer.",
    "Router": "Interconnects two or more computer networks and routes data packets.",
    "Gateway": "Interfaces with another network using different protocols."
}

for device, description in network_devices.items():
    print(f"{device}: {description}")
```

### Problem 3: Data Link Layer Framing Methods

#### Character Stuffing and Bit Stuffing in Python

```python
def character_stuffing(data):
    flag = "/"
    escape = "E"
    stuffed_data = flag
    for char in data:
        if char == flag or char == escape:
            stuffed_data += escape
        stuffed_data += char
    stuffed_data += flag
    return stuffed_data

def character_destuffing(stuffed_data):
    flag = "/"
    escape = "E"
    destuffed_data = ""
    escape_mode = False
    for char in stuffed_data[1:-1]:  # Ignore the flags at the beginning and end
        if escape_mode:
            destuffed_data += char
            escape_mode = False
        elif char == escape:
            escape_mode = True
        else:
            destuffed_data += char
    return destuffed_data

data = "AEFGHTJ"
stuffed = character_stuffing(data)
print("Stuffed Data:", stuffed)
print("Destuffed Data:", character_destuffing(stuffed))

def bit_stuffing(data):
    stuffed = ""
    count = 0
    for bit in data:
        if bit == "1":
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        stuffed += bit
        if count == 5:
            stuffed += "0"
            count = 0
    return stuffed

def bit_destuffing(data):
    destuffed = ""
    count = 0
    for bit in data:
        if bit == "1":
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        destuffed += bit
        if count == 5:
            count = 0  # Skip the stuffed "0"
    return destuffed

binary_data = "011111110110"
stuffed_bits = bit_stuffing(binary_data)
print("Bit Stuffed Data:", stuffed_bits)
print("Bit Destuffed Data:", bit_destuffing(stuffed_bits))
```

### Problem 4: CRC Implementation

```python
def xor(a, b):
    return ''.join('0' if x == y else '1' for x, y in zip(a, b))

def divide(data, divisor):
    pick = len(divisor)
    temp = data[:pick]
    while pick < len(data):
        if temp[0] == '1':
            temp = xor(divisor, temp) + data[pick]
        else:
            temp = xor('0' * pick, temp) + data[pick]
        pick += 1
    if temp[0] == '1':
        temp = xor(divisor, temp)
    else:
        temp = xor('0' * pick, temp)
    return temp

def crc(data, divisor):
    appended_data = data + '0' * (len(divisor) - 1)
    remainder = divide(appended_data, divisor)
    return data + remainder

data = "1001101"
divisor = "1011"
encoded_data = crc(data, divisor)
print("Encoded Data:", encoded_data)
```

### Problem 5: Dijkstra's Algorithm

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]

    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

print("Shortest paths:", dijkstra(graph, 'A'))
```

I'll continue with the rest of the problems in the next message!

### Problem 6: Distance Vector Routing Algorithm

```python
def distance_vector_routing(cost_matrix):
    num_nodes = len(cost_matrix)
    distance_vectors = [[float('inf')] * num_nodes for _ in range(num_nodes)]
    next_hops = [[None] * num_nodes for _ in range(num_nodes)]

    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(num_nodes):
            distance_vectors[i][j] = cost_matrix[i][j]
            if cost_matrix[i][j] != float('inf'):
                next_hops[i][j] = j

    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        for i in range(num_nodes):
            for j in range(num_nodes):
                for k in range(num_nodes):
                    if distance_vectors[i][j] > distance_vectors[i][k] + distance_vectors[k][j]:
                        distance_vectors[i][j] = distance_vectors[i][k] + distance_vectors[k][j]
                        next_hops[i][j] = next_hops[i][k]
                        changed = True

    for i in range(num_nodes):
        print(f"Router {i + 1}:")
        for j in range(num_nodes):
            print(f"  To node {j + 1}: Next hop {next_hops[i][j] + 1}, Distance {distance_vectors[i][j]}")
        print()

cost_matrix = [
    [0, 2, 7],
    [2, 0, 1],
    [7, 1, 0]
]
distance_vector_routing(cost_matrix)
```

### Problem 7: RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Simulation

Python's `xmlrpc` library can be used for basic RPC.

#### Server Code

```python
from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer

def count_input_length(input_string):
    return len(input_string)

server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))
server.register_function(count_input_length, "count_input_length")
print("RPC server is running...")
server.serve_forever()
```

#### Client Code

```python
import xmlrpc.client

client = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000/")
input_string = input("Type something: ")
length = client.count_input_length(input_string)
print(f"You have typed {length} letters!")
```

### Problem 8a: Echo Client and Server with TCP

#### Server Code

```python
import socket

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind(("localhost", 4000))
server_socket.listen(1)
print("Server is ready...")

client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Connection from {address}")

while True:
    message = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
    if not message or message.lower() == "bye":
        break
    print(f"Client: {message}")
    client_socket.send(message.encode())

client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
```

#### Client Code

```python
import socket

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect(("localhost", 4000))

while True:
    message = input("You: ")
    client_socket.send(message.encode())
    if message.lower() == "bye":
        break
    response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
    print(f"Server: {response}")

client_socket.close()
```

### Problem 9: HTTP Web Client to Download Webpage

```python
import socket

def download_webpage(host, port, path):
    client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    client_socket.connect((host, port))
    request = f"GET {path} HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: {host}\r\n\r\n"
    client_socket.send(request.encode())
    response = client_socket.recv(4096).decode()
    client_socket.close()
    return response

host = "example.com"
path = "/"
port = 80
webpage = download_webpage(host, port, path)
print(webpage)
```

I'll complete the remaining problems next.

### Problem 10a: DNS Resolution Using UDP Sockets

#### Server Code

```python
import socket

dns_records = {
    "example.com": "93.184.216.34",
    "google.com": "142.250.74.206",
    "facebook.com": "31.13.71.36"
}

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
server_socket.bind(("localhost", 5353))
print("DNS Server is running...")

while True:
    message, client_address = server_socket.recvfrom(1024)
    domain = message.decode().strip()
    ip_address = dns_records.get(domain, "Host not found")
    server_socket.sendto(ip_address.encode(), client_address)
```

#### Client Code

```python
import socket

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
server_address = ("localhost", 5353)

domain = input("Enter the domain name: ")
client_socket.sendto(domain.encode(), server_address)

response, _ = client_socket.recvfrom(1024)
print(f"IP Address: {response.decode()}")
client_socket.close()
```

### Problem 10b: File Transfer Using TCP

#### Server Code

```python
import socket

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind(("localhost", 6000))
server_socket.listen(1)
print("File server is running...")

client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Connection from {address}")

filename = "example.txt"
with open(filename, "rb") as file:
    while (chunk := file.read(1024)):
        client_socket.send(chunk)

client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
print("File sent successfully.")
```

#### Client Code

        if not chunk:
            break
        file.write(chunk)

client_socket.close()
print(f"File received and saved as {filename}.")

These Python codes address all problems from the provided document. If you'd like further refinements or specific explanations for any part, let me know!


===================================================================
Here are the **Windows Command Prompt** equivalents for the commands mentioned in the first question. 

### Problem 1: Commands for Network Protocol Analysis (Windows)

1. **`tcpdump` Alternative:**
   - Install Wireshark or use **`dumpcap`** (included with Wireshark).
   - Example to capture all packets:
     ```bash
     dumpcap -i 1 -w captured_packets.pcap
     ```
   - Replace `-i 1` with the correct interface index using:
     ```bash
     dumpcap -D
     ```

2. **`netstat`:**
   - View active TCP/UDP connections:
     ```bash
     netstat -an
     ```
   - View listening ports:
     ```bash
     netstat -an | find "LISTENING"
     ```
   - View detailed statistics:
     ```bash
     netstat -s
     ```

3. **`ifconfig` Alternative (`ipconfig`):**
   - Display IP configuration:
     ```bash
     ipconfig
     ```
   - Display detailed IP configuration:
     ```bash
     ipconfig /all
     ```

4. **`nslookup`:**
   - Query the DNS record for a domain:
     ```bash
     nslookup example.com
     ```
   - Reverse lookup for an IP address:
     ```bash
     nslookup 8.8.8.8
     ```

5. **`traceroute` Alternative (`tracert`):**
   - Trace the route to a domain:
     ```bash
     tracert example.com
     ```

6. **Capture and Analyze Traffic Using Wireshark:**
   - Install Wireshark for a graphical interface or use `tshark` (command-line version of Wireshark).
   - Example to filter ICMP packets:
     ```bash
     tshark -f "icmp"
     ```

### Summary Command Script:
You can save these commands in a `.bat` script for automated execution:

```bat
@echo off
echo --- Running Network Commands ---
ipconfig /all
netstat -an
nslookup example.com
tracert example.com
pause
```
